# Golang and VSCode

## My background

I was born 1976 and I write software since I am 12 years old.

Seven years ago I switched from Emacs to PyCharm.

In 2022 I learned Go, which is now part of my daily work as Cloud Engineer at [Syself](https://syself.com/).

Here are my notes which I wrote down while switching from an IntellJ based IDE to vscode.

## Shortcuts

F2: refactor (rename Method)

ctrl-` --> show/hide terminal.

ctrl-space --> autocomplete (for example find the struct in a package and add the package name before the name)

Bookmark plugin: ctrl-alt-k (set bookmarks), ctrl-alt-j (jump to bookmarks, multiple times to jump to other bookmarks)

You want to open a file from the terminal: `> code foo.go`

"Show all commands": ctrl+shift+p

ctrl-. --> "Quick fix" (for example fill struct)

ctrl-shift-p "open recent" --> Open recent Workspace. This is better than "File > Open Recent" because it provides autocomplete. By default this is mappend to ctrl-r, but I use ctrl-r for "Terminal: Run Recent Command".


# Formatting

ctrl-s --> format and clean file. For example you get `.../foo_test.go:24:2: imported and not used: "github.com/somerepo/somepkg"` since you removed the usage of "somepkg", then you don't need to move up to the import statements. Just hit ctrl-s.



# Tests

ctrl-shift-p "Go: Generate Unit Tests for File". But I don't use the table-driven test which vscode generates. I prefer boring straightforward tests, except I would have many rows in the table of the table-driven test. Related: [table-driven tests are overrated](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/10e9ebg/tabledriven_tests_are_overrated/)


# Navigation

"Go to file": ctrl+p


ctrl-e --> switch between recently used files. Good if you want to swith to the previous file quickly. Otherwise I prefer ctrl-p


ctrl-g --> goto line


alt-shift-CursorLeft/Right move to previous places

f4 --> goto next search result (for example after a search with ctrl-shift-f): Related https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75161780/go-to-first-match-of-ctrl-shift-f-search




go to beginning of a function: click on last element in breadcrumb-bar, then ENTER. Or use `ctrl-shift-. ENTER` to open breadcrumb bar. 


"Go to Symbol in Workspac": ctrl-t. Not very useful, since it shows the symbols of all imported libraries. I usually don't find my code this way. Related: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75085670/vscode-symbol-search-but-only-in-my-code and https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37236

After a search the searched term is still highlighted. I use ctrl-b to hide the panel on the left side, which removes the highlighting. Maybe there is an alternative solution?

# Plugins

[Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go) Official Plugin, provided by the Go team at Google.

[YAML (from Red Hat)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) YAML Language Support by Red Hat, with built-in Kubernetes syntax support (uses [prettier](https://prettier.io/) under the hood).

# settings.json

```
    "gopls": {
        "importShortcut": "Definition"
    }
```
--> if you click on an import line (for example `myname "github.com/foo/bar")`) you get to the code of "foo/bar" in vscode. Don't open the browser.  Related: [Don't Open Imports in the Browser](https://dominikbraun.io/blog/vs-code-go-dont-open-imports-in-browser/)

# ripgrep in vscode

in .bashrc:
```
if [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == 'vscode' ]]; then
  alias 'rg'='rg --no-heading --column'
fi
```

Then you get output like this:
```
foo/bar.go:33:43: ... your term
```

And `foo/bar.go:33` is a hyperlink you can click.

# Config

## Custom Keybindings

In general I try to use the keybindings of vscode. Here are some keybindings which I configured.

ctrl-รถ --> "Go: Test function at Cursor or Test Previous"

ctrl-r --> "Terminal: Run Recent Command". This is the same keybinding like searching backwards in the shell history :-)
Example: run `make test`.

## GitLens

Disable `gitlens.currentLine.enabled`. Especially the popup on hover makes too much noise.

Above setting did not remove all pop-ups. I disabled the GitLens plugin.


# Support for Yaml: autocomplete

I am editing a file called golangci.yaml.

The editor vscode provides autocomplete. It somehow seems to understand the format.

That's magic und very helpful.

history for selection

recently changed locations.

Nice color theme. Overall vscode is a bit too colorful.

# Not solved yet

Copy+Paste does not work in the git-diff view of deleted lines: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8226

I would like to have a better visual differentiation between my code and code from third party packages. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75181580/higlight-files-which-are-not-from-my-repository

# TODO

* ctrl-t to open new browser tab. I don't like to keep a state in my head. I am very used to open a new browser tab with ctrl-t. It should work in vscode, too.

* alt-shift-left/right for going to the previous locations is too far away. I need to move my pointer fingers away from F and J. Something I try to avoid.

My cursor is on the name of a method which implements an interface. I want to see the docstring of this method of the interface. How to get to navigate to the method signature of the interface?

Search in a directory which is outside my workspace: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75244211/vscode-search-in-a-directory-which-is-outside-the-workspace

Jump from method to corresponding interface which defines the methos signature: ctrl-shift-p "Find All Implementations", then F4 (jump to first match of the search result). In Goland you have icons near the line-numbers to jump up/down. This could be improved. Related: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2628
